We examine the effect of mandatory International Financial Reporting
Standards ('IFRS') adoption on firms' information environment. We find that
after mandatory IFRS adoption consensus forecast errors decrease for firms
that mandatorily adopt IFRS relative to forecast errors of other firms. We also
find decreasing forecast errors for voluntary adopters, but this effect is smaller
and not robust. Moreover, we show that the magnitude of the forecast errors
decrease is associated with the firm-specific differences between local GAAP
and IFRS. Exploiting individual analyst level data and isolating settings where
investors would benefit more from either increased comparability or higher
quality information, we document that the improvement in the information
environment is driven both by information and comparability effects. These
results are robust to variations in the measurement of information environment
quality, forecast horizon, sample composition and tests of earnings
management.
