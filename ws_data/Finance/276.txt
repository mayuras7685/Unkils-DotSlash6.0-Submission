Small businesses are core to America's economic competitiveness. Not only do they employ half of the nation's private sector workforce-about 120 million people-but also since 1995 they have created approximately two-thirds of the net new jobs in our country. Yet in recent years, small businesses have been slow to recover from a recession and credit crisis that hit them especially hard. This lag has prompted the question, "Is there a credit gap in small business lending?" This paper compiles and analyzes the current state of access to bank capital for small business from the best available sources. We explore both the cyclical impact of the recession on small business and access to credit and several structural issues in that impede the full recovery of bank credit markets for smaller loans.
