We use an important legal event as a natural experiment to
examine the effect of management fiduciary duties on equity‐debt
conflicts. A 1991 Delaware bankruptcy ruling changed the nature of
corporate directors' fiduciary duties in firms incorporated in that state.
This change limited managers' incentives to take actions favoring
equity over debt for firms in the vicinity of financial distress. We show
that this ruling increased the likelihood of equity issues, increased
investment, and reduced firm risk, consistent with a decrease in debtequity
conflicts of interest. The changes are isolated to firms relatively
closer to default. The ruling was also followed by an increase in
average leverage and a reduction in covenant use. Finally, we estimate
the welfare implications of this change and find that firm values
increased when the rules were introduced. We conclude that
managerial fiduciary duties affect equity‐bond holder conflicts in a way
that is economically important, has impact on ex ante capital structure
choices, and affects welfare.
