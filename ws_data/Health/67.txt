Developing countries increasingly use biometric identification technology to improve the reliability of administrative information and deliver social services more efficiently. This paper exploits the random placement of biometric devices in tuberculosis (TB) treatment centers in urban slums across four Indian states. The devices record health worker attendance and patient adherence to protocol, and they automatically prompt follow-up treatment. We combine data from surveys, independent field visits, and government registers to identify impacts on TB-control outcomes and the quality of data. First, we find that patients enrolled at centers with biometric monitoring are 25% less likely to interrupt their treatment than those at regular centersâ€”an improvement driven by increased attendance and efforts by health workers and greater protocol adherence by patients. Second, the biometric devices decrease overreporting of patient numbers in both NGO data and government registers by 20% and underreporting of treatment interruptions by 25%. We find no effect on worker or patient satisfaction. This suggests biometric technology is both an effective and sustainable way to improve the state capacity to deliver healthcare in challenging areas.
