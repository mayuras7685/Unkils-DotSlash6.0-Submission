The Harvard Business School Covid-19 Global Policy Tracker is an initiative by the Business, Government and the International Economy (BGIE) unit at Harvard Business School (HBS) to collect and standardize economic policies implemented as a response to the coronavirus pandemic around the world. We focus on fiscal policy, monetary policy, and lockdowns and quantify government responses in common variables, units, and currencies to facilitate cross-country comparisons. The database is updated in real time with the efforts of several dozens of students at HBS and other Harvard schools.
