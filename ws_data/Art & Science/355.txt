Interviewee: Dr. Jessica Ray, Assistant Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Washington Interviewer: Emily Kerr, PhD Candidate in Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Harvard University What happens when the rain dissolves potentially dangerous metals, organic chemicals, and other contaminants after a storm? In this episode of the Pint-Sized Science Podcast, we sat down with Dr. Jessica Ray, a professor at the University of Washington whose research is focused on developing materials and technologies to remove dangerous contaminants from stormwater before it reaches our waterways.
