Time: 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 3rd Join us on: Zoom (password: science) or YouTube Live Speakers: David Mazumder Graphics: Jasmin Joseph-Chazan  Doomsayers (and world experts) tell us that our future could look like the ultimate disaster movie come to life unless we take action to prevent “catastrophic global warming.” In this unfolding drama, economic costs and disruptive technologies play leading roles, but our warming world and its changing climate also threatens our health, birthing new illnesses and worsening old ones from asthma to artery disease. The same solutions that could preserve humanity’s place on our planet, though, could just make its future healthier, too. Together, we’ll explore climate change and its solutions’ wide-ranging effects on our health and use a cutting-edge climate simulator to identify the solutions that make the biggest differences, both for us and the planet.
