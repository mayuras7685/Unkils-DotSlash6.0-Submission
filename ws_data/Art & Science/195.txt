Time: 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 17th Join us on: Zoom (password: science) or YouTube Live Speakers: Eileen Ablondi Graphics: Olivia Foster Rhoades  Your DNA contains the instructions to make every part of your body. But who’s reading these instructions? How do our cells know whether to be brain cells, skin cells, or something entirely different? And what happens when things go wrong? In this lecture, we’ll explore how cells store and make sense of the information in DNA, and how these processes offer us points of interventions to treat cancer and other diseases.
