Amazon rainforest, one of the “New 7 Wonders of Nature of the World”, will definitely be a WOW moment for you. Amazon rainforest is the paradise for millions of plant and animal species. Beyond being a grand botanic garden and zoo of the planet, scientific studies have revealed a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet. The rain forests, which contain 90-140 billion metric tons of carbon, help stabilize local and global climate. Human activities, including deforestation and biomass burning, may release significant amounts of this carbon, which could have catastrophic consequences around the world. Join us for a fascinating ride through different shades of green to explore wonders and challenges in the Amazon rainforest. Currently you have JavaScript disabled.
