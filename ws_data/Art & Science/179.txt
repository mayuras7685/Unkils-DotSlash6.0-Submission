Interviewee: Lindley Winslow, Associate Professor of Physics, MITInterviewer: Melis Tekant, PhD student in Physics, MIT To uncover the nature of the elusive building blocks of the universe, scientists must observe some of the rarest events. How does one accomplish this? With an international team of researchers, in a years long project, using a giant, underground, super-cooled crystal. Professor Lindley Winslow explains the science, the considerations that go into planning and carrying out such large scientific projects, and how she got interested in the field. She also talks about how she got the opportunity to act as a science advisor for the newest Ghostbusters movie!For more information on Prof. Winslow’s lab, please visit winslow.mit.edu/ i am Marguerite o reilly , from belfast
