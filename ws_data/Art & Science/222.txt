Interviewee: Iain Cheeseman, Professor of Biology at the Whitehead Institute and MIT Interviewer: Melis Tekant (PhD student in Physics, MIT) During cell division, a cell creates an identical copy of itself, but how does this process happen? Specifically, how does a cell distribute its genetic material among the two daughter cells? Join us as Professor Iain Cheeseman of MIT and the Whitehead Institute explains how he and his team uncover the molecular basis of the protein complex called the kinetochore, the cellular machinery which is at the heart of this process.
