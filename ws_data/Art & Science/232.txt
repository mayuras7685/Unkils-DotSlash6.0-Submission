Time: 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, February 17th Join us on: Zoom (password: science) or YouTube Live Speaker: Floor Broekgaarden Graphics: Rebecca Senft  Kanye West & Kim Kardashian, and Brad Pitt & Angelie Jolie –  just a few of the famous star couples who broke up their relationship. Star breakups are not only common on Earth, but also in space, where many stars exist as couples.  The majority of these couples have a rocky relationship, but in very exceptional cases their “marriages” have a happily ever after. Only these matches made in heaven will produce some of the most energetic and beautiful collisions in space known as “gravitational waves”.  In this talk we will learn how stars find true love in space, and how we as scientists are able to find these star-crossed lovers and detect gravitational waves. It’s not that simple, but thankfully we can find the secret in an unexpected place — the board game Battleship. Currently you have JavaScript disabled.
