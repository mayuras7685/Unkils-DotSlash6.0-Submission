We are waiting for scientists to produce a life-saving vaccine that can prevent the serious illness COVID-19 and help bring this pandemic to an end. Currently, there are nearly 200 different vaccines in various stages of development. How does SARS-CoV-2 cause disease, and how do vaccines work to prevent us from getting sick? How are scientists and manufacturers working together to safely speed up the vaccine development process which typically takes years? In this lecture, we will discuss how we can enable the immune system to fight serious infection. This presentation should not replace medical advice from a qualified physician. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact your local health authorities for guidance.

I had to go to the ER and they did a CoV2 test on me. As I looked a my chart I saw an interesting disclaimer under the “neg” results; to parpaphrase: this test is NOT to be used to Dx CoV2 infection. However, because of an emergency declaration of the [Trump] FDA, the results of this PCR test can be used to indicate CoV2 infection negativity until the FDA withdraws this emergency approval!
