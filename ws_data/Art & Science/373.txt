Interviewee: Dr. Verónica Martínez-Cerdeño, Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis Interviewer: Valentina Lagomarsino, PhD Candidate in the Biological Sciences, Harvard University In this episode of the Pint-Sized Science Podcast, we sat down with Dr. Verónica Martínez-Cerdeño, a professor at UC Davis whose research is focused on improving our basic understanding of how the brain functions and how it changes in the setting of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. In addition to talking about her scientific work, we also spoke with her about her work outside of the lab, including how she established the first brain bank in Latin America and started a non-profit to help teach young children about the benefits of learning about the brain.
