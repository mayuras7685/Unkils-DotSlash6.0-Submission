Interviewee: Hernan Garcia, Assistant Professor of Physics and Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley Interviewer: Jonathan Jackson, PhD student in Biophysics, Harvard University How does a single cell give rise to a complicated organism? What controls how a DNA blueprint can give rise to so many different cell behaviors in so regulated a manner? How can statistical mechanics (we promise it’s not too scary!) help scientists to address long-standing questions of developmental biology? Join us as we talk with Dr. Hernan Garcia, a professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley, about how he and his lab investigate these questions by predicting developmental decisions in fruit flies.

Thanks for stopping by, and take care until next time! We love science and learning about the world around us, so we are always drawn to books … It is important to help instill an attitude of inquiry from an early age.
