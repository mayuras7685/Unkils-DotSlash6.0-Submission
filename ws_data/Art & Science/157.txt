Interviewee: Dr. Sara Cherry, Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of PennsylvaniaInterviewer: Hope Merens, PhD Student in Molecular Biology, Harvard University Over the past year, COVID-19 has affected every aspect of our society. The cause of the pandemic, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is one of many existing RNA viruses. But not every virus causes a pandemic. What makes SARS-CoV-2 so infectious? How does our body react to a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how does this compare to other infections? And finally, what novel antiviral therapies are scientists working on to protect us from SARS-CoV-2 and future viruses? Join us this week on the Pint-Sized Science podcast as we discuss these questions with Dr. Sara Cherry, a leading professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
