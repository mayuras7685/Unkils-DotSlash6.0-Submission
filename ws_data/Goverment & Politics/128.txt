Prior to the 2013 elections in Kenya, the Electoral Commission sent 11 million nonpartisan text messages to registered voters in an effort to boost electoral participation. The messages had a positive effect on turnout but also decreased trust in Kenyan electoral institutions. We show that the information campaign backfired because the Electoral Commission failed to fulfill its commitment to deliver a transparent and peaceful election. The decrease in trust is stronger in areas that experienced election-related violence and for individuals affiliated (via their ethnicity) with the side that lost the presidential election. These results highlight the trade-offs associated with mobilizing voters in recently established democracies.
