Old‐style realpolitik - bilateral, sentiment‐free, and organized by great powers - has returned to
Europe, thereby wreaking havoc on traditions of solidarism and multilateralism in the
European Union. The renaissance of the Russian state and the rise of Gazprom, Russia's natural
gas monopoly, have produced patterns of international politics that seemed almost
inconceivable just a few years ago. Three of Europe's major powers - France, Germany, and
Italy - have cultivated bilateral energy relations with Russia at the expense of a common stance
on the continent's dependence on Russian gas, and much to dismay of other EU members.
This pattern of international relations carries profound implications for theory and practice. I
argue that the obvious theoretical conclusion and conventional practical understanding of these
politics are both wrong. The roots of this realpolitik cannot be found in realist theory. Europe's
realpolitik has, instead, fundamentally commercial and ideational origins. Firms, not states, have
literally conducted this realpolitik. The empirical puzzles presented in this paper imply a
theoretical challenge for international political economy, which has, as a field, failed to
understand deeply how firms work and what kinds of roles they have come to play in
contemporary international relations. In this paper I propose some theoretical foundations for a
better understanding of commercial realpolitik: great‐power politics based on the profit motives
and shared ideas of firms.
