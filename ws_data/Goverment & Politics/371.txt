For all the coverage of the Presidential primaries, only half of eligible voters will likely cast ballots in November. While 20 percent of U.S. adults are political junkies, the rest can't spare the time, don't think their vote will matter, see no important differences among the candidates, or are turned off by the electoral process and candidates' campaign tactics.  They are the "vanishing voters" of U.S. politics. There are 5 structural reasons why this is the case.  Yet there are reasons for hope. Citizen interest in this year's primaries is high because there is no obvious winner and genuinely different candidates are competing on both sides. The Internet has greatly increased the opportunity for non-establishment, underfunded candidates to develop viable grass-roots campaigns. Voter questions and candidate answers in town meetings are now the standard. In other words, this year's election process so far seems more open and democratic than ever. Around $20 per vote will be spent on political advertising in this year's presidential campaign. By commercial standards, and given the importance of the purchase decision, that doesn't seem high. What's needed in politics is not less marketing but better marketing: focusing on current and emerging customer needs, developing product and service solutions, informing interested citizens about them, and making them easily accessible. I remember Leonard Marsh, 1 of the 3 founders of Snapple, explaining the brand's success: "We never thought of ourselves as any better than our customers." Politicians need to view citizens not as occasional voters, donors, and taxpayers but as their customers.  What do you think? Join the discussion on Harvard Business Online.
