Renters are the forgotten underclass of American policymakers. Although a third of all U.S. citizens rent their dwelling, rental stock is in poor shape, short supply, and expensive. With subprime defaults continuing, it appears as if the situation will only worsen as former home owners now seek shelter in the rental market. In the new book Revisiting Rental Housing: Policies, Programs, and Priorities, editors Nicolas Retsinas and Eric Belsky bring together research and analysis looking at the current state of affairs, how we got there, and how we might improve the lot of the American renter. In this podcast, Retsinas, who teaches at Harvard Business School and is director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, discusses his work.
