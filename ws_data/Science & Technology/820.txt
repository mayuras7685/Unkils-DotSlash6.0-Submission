They can be pretty, but having too many in one place is a problem. The subject is jellyfish, the focus of a new exhibit at Le Laboratoire Cambridge. “The Trouble with Jellyfish” was created by artist Mark Dion in collaboration with marine biologist Lisa-ann Gershwin and David Edwards, the Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Idea Translation in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, a core faculty member in Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and founder of Le Laboratoire. Working with Edwards’ Harvard students, Dion and Gershwin explored solutions that could deal with increasingly large and frequent jellyfish blooms that are a telltale sign of degraded ocean ecosystems. The jellyfish are less the problem than the pollution, overfishing, and climate change that are undercutting healthy ocean life. The video helps show what is happening and what could be done about it. Le Laboratoire is an art and design center that explores the experiments and findings of innovators on the frontiers of science. The exhibit, sponsored in part by the Wyss Institute and presented in partnership with the New England Aquarium, will run until Jan. 2 at 650 East Kendall St., Cambridge. The gallery hours are noon to 9 p.m. on Wednesdays through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays.
