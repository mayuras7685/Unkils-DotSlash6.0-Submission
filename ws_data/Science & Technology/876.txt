Earth Day was created as a call to action, to raise awareness and spur a movement focused on the steps people need to take to rethink how they live on this planet. That spirit lives on every day at Harvard in its laboratories, its classrooms, and in how the campus operates. Substantive and scalable solutions to the challenges of climate change and sustainable development are most powerful, analysts say, when they are generated at the intersection of disciplines, powered through the ingenuity of students, and connected to real-world problems locally. The Harvard Climate Change Solutions Fund is one example of how the University is catalyzing the research and innovations needed to accelerate progress toward cleaner energy and a healthier, more sustainable future.
