## **Inspiration**

I used to refer a lot of documents and I was facing disorganization issue with the documents. then I did some research regarding this issue and find out many of my friends and teachers suffer with same issues. Then I started refering to multiple solution for this problems. And found out this one practical implementation.

## Problem Statment : 

## **What it does**

It basically classifies documents into categories.

## **How we built it**
Using React, we have built web-app to provide user interface and collect documents. Then using flask, we have built server to actually use the ML model on data. After it will transfer documents from web-app to server. We will extract features from documents and pass it to ML model and then it will generate category output.

## **Challenges we ran into**
It was really got messy, when we started implementing server. But make it out of it.

## **What we learned**
While building a project, we should always consider its scalability in future.

## **Built With**
